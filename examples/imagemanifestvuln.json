A local authenticated attacker could use this flaw to kill other processes with root privileges under specific conditions. (CVE-2017-2616) Red Hat would like to thank Tobias Stöckmann for reporting this issue. Bug Fix(es): * The \"findmnt --target \u003cpath\u003e\" command prints all file systems where the mount point directory is \u003cpath\u003e. Previously, when used in the chroot environment, \"findmnt --target \u003cpath\u003e\" incorrectly displayed all mount points. The command has been fixed so that it now checks the mount point path and returns information only for the relevant mount point. (BZ#1414481)",

(CVE-2014-9761) * It was found that out-of-range time values passed to the strftime() function could result in an out-of-bounds memory access. This could lead to application crash or, potentially, information disclosure. (CVE-2015-8776) * An integer overflow vulnerability was found in hcreate() and hcreate_r() functions which could result in an out-of-bounds memory access. This could lead to application crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2015-8778) * A stack based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the catopen() function. An excessively long string passed to the function could cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8779) * It was found that the dynamic loader did not sanitize the LD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable.
